There was a voice message sent by aliens but they could not understand. They immediately informed higher officials of the office, but they also could not understand the information sent by aliens. They immediately contacted NASA and other countries' space research organizations to know what the information sent by aliens was. On the other side, John and Neha are working on that voice message. But again, none of the organizations could understand the message. When one scientist listened to that message, he started building algorithms to find the information inside the message. Many were trying to find the information in that message. At the last somehow ISRO engineering was successful understanding the information which was sent by aliens.

## Chapter 3: 

One day, humans started noticing aliens in the sky. They immediately informed higher officials. Robots, weapons, and rockets are released. These weapons were killing aliens. After around 1000 Aliens were killed, aliens also started killing robots and humans. This was the tough phase of the war. And this man named Musk, who was the SpaceX CEO, came with his weapons. He built powerful robots which killed almost all the aliens. But the situation did not seem to improve. Billions of aliens came to the earth and fought with the robots, army, and our weapons. And the robots started killing humans and nuclear weapons were being released into the humans' areas, due to some technical glitch in the algorithms in robots and weapons. Almost every human is killed. Aliens are killing the important and powerful persons in the world such as prime ministers, judges, scientists, etc. they are even killing small children and animals, At last, every human was killed by aliens, robots, and self-made weapons.
 
At the start of the story Neha got two signals from the aliens - one was a voice message and the other was a message translator. She informed only John. And John took Neha to the rich scientist and explained the total scenario. Scientists offered both of them 100 crores to not convey the actual message to the world.

The actual message was that aliens are coming to earth to make a healthy relationship between humans and aliens. They wanted to develop the planet Earth with their technologies and cure all the diseases plaguing the humans. The scientist said to Neha and John that aliens are attacking the world. "If you both say this information to your office I would offer 100 crores" said the scientist. John and Neha started thinking about this. They thought that even if there are no aliens, our world would be good enough to survive. And they accepted the offer. Scientists modified the information from "helping world" to "attack the world". And the message was announced by ISRO officials.

Aliens came to Neha and John killed their parents and children in front of them and of course, they were also killed.
And the world has been occupied by aliens.
